# Hideout

With patch 3.0 we get access to a personal space inside the trader zone that is called "Hideout".  
The entrance to it, is located left of the guitar guy on the hatch.  
It costs 5 gold to unlock.

Inside the hideout there are Modules that need to be upgraded before they can be used.  
Stash is usable without upgrade and offers some basic space to store your gear.  

Press O to see where the Modules are and TAB to interact with them.

## Utility

The point of the Hideout is to give players a place to:

- Store Raiding Gear
- [Train Strength](link)

- Cook
- Rest

*These features will be added in a later patch and are not currently in the game
