# Welcome to MkDocs of A3S-Wiki

What is the vision for the mod?
Arma 3 Survival strives to bring the nostalgia of Dayz mod to Arma 3. Additionally, we are adding new features and updates to enhance the experience and make a truly immersive survival mod. The vision of the mod is to create a harder survival experience than what you may find in most Dayz servers while having more content that assists in the immersion of the players.
