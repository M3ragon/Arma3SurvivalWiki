## How do I build a base?

The first thing you need is a Workbench. This creates your area, in which you can then build your base

## Where I get some food and drinks?

Food and drink spawns mainly in civilian areas. There is a chance that in the military area something spawns is lower!

## Where is the trader?

The trader is marked on the map with the following icon

## Is there AI on the map?

Yes there is AI. This protects a secret point on the map! But there is no AI that patrols the whole map.

## Where can I find stones?

Stones must be mined with a pickaxe, at mines . This goes the same way as you get wood from trees!

## After restart i lost my clothes. Is this a normal?

Its a known arma bug, that sometimes people have no clothes on. Thats why you should always disconnect over the abort button.

## How do I link the DiscordBot to my account?

go to the homepage and log in there. Then you can connect your account to Discord.

## Why we don't add the mod "Enhanced Movement"?

Inserting the mod opens too many possibilities for exploiting bugs and map errors. For this reason, it will not be inserted for the time being. In the current state, for example, gates and walls would lose their meaning almost completely.
